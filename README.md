# DKE-GCN
This is the implementation of Decoupled Knowledge Emedded Graph Convolutional Network for Skeleton-based Action Recognition, which has been submitted to ICCV2023. We have verified the effectiveness of our distillation paradigm in CTR-GCN and MS-G3D.


Currently, we only provide a few pre-trained models based on CTR-GCN.  We are sorting out the project and uploading it within several weeks, including the all code and more pre-trained models.
